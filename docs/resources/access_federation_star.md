```terraform
resource "missioncontrol_access_federation_star" "my-star" {
  id = "JPD-1"
  entities = ["USERS", "GROUPS", "PERMISSIONS"]
  targets = [
    {
      id = "JPD-2"
      url = "http://myartifactory-2.jfrog.io/access"
      permission_filters = {
        include_patterns = ["some-regex"]

- `permission_filters` (Attributes) When assigning entity types to targets, you can assign specific permissions to be synchronized using the `include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns` regular expressions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--targets--permission_filters))

<a id="nestedatt--targets--permission_filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `targets.permission_filters`

Optional:

- `exclude_patterns` (Set of String)
